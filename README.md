# Formal Verification for OL Network Contracts

This repository contains formal verification specifications for the **`ol_account` module** from the OL Network. These specs are written in the **Move language** and demonstrate how formal verification ensures the correctness and safety of smart contracts.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- **[Specs](specs/ol_account_spec.move):** Detailed specifications for the `ol_account` module.
- **OL Network Contracts:**

## Why Formal Verification Matters

Formal verification ensures that smart contracts behave correctly under all conditions, reducing the risk of bugs and exploits. By writing and verifying these specs, I demonstrate my ability to:

- Analyze and secure Move-based smart contracts.
- Define **preconditions, postconditions,** and **invariants** for safe execution.
- Apply formal methods to decentralized financial systems.
